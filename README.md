# MIPS_Processor
Building a MIPS reduced instruction set computer involved breaking the entire component down into several stages:
* Instruction fetch and decode
* Execute Stage
* Memory and Writeback stage

Each stage was built and tested step by step using their respective testbenches and test values before combining them using the structural style in VHDL.
Components such as logic gates, multiplexers, and arithmetic logic units were created.
